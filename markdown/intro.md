<!-- Note -->
你们好。 我很高兴您在这里，也感谢您有机会与您交谈。

Nǐmen hǎo. Wǒ hěn gāoxìng nín zài zhèlǐ, yě gǎnxiè nín yǒu jīhuì yǔ nín
jiāotán.

Welcome.

This talk is a about a few helpful handy things that OpenStack can do
for you. Chances are, the OpenStack cloud that you’re running or
using is already configured to do all of what I am talking about.

But over time I’ve come to realize that a remarkable number of even
experienced OpenStack users and operators don’t know about them. So
I’m here to change that.

My name’s Florian, I am in charge of professional services and
education at City Network, and for the past 6 years I’ve helped people
deploy, operate, and understand OpenStack.

Now this talk assumes that you have *some* familiarity with *using*
OpenStack. It doesn’t make any assumptions about your experience
*deploying* OpenStack. In fact you might find this talk useful even if
you’ve never deployed OpenStack, and don’t plan to. But it does assume
some familiarity with basic OpenStack functionality, such as how to
create an instance — a VM —, how to upload an image, and so on. But
first off, let’s start with something really easy.
